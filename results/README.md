## Results

This folder contains the fit data used for the lab's analysis. Each of the folders corresponds to the tuning and fitting of all models using the specified recipe. 

- `bt_` --> boosted trees

- `ann_` --> neural networks regression

- `rf_` --> random forest

- `enet_` --> elastic net

- `mars_` --> MARS

- `lm_` --> linear regression

- `null_` --> null model

### Additional Fitting

- `final_fit.rda` --> the fit of the winning model on the entire training set

- `keep_wflow_rsample.rda` --> controls for fitting resamples
